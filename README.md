## Building a server PC and searching for best hardware

**Selecting the right components for a Minecraft server PC is crucial for delivering a smooth and enjoyable gaming experience to players. Here's why it's essential to pick the best parts and prioritize a CPU with high GHz and ample RAM**

1. The most important part of our build will be our CPU:

* Minecraft servers require real-time processing power to handle player interactions, world generation, various game mechanics, plugins and scripts. A powerful CPU with a high clock speed (GHz) ensures that the server can respond quickly to player actions, minimizing lag and delays. Before buying one from the internet I was reserching a lot of the internet. One of the best things you should look for are older CPUs with high clock speed that needs a cheap motherboard if you have low budget. But if you have unlimited money to spend on your server PC you can get one of the newest AMD Ryzen CPU and that should work perfectly.

* If you are looking for a budget build you need around $150 for CPU for a smooth server experience. Here are best CPUs for every price range:

Intel CPUs with high clock speed:<br>
➤ i9-11900K ($400-$500)<br>
➤ i7-11700K ($300-$400)<br>
➤ i5-11600K ($200-$300)<br>
➤ i3-10100 ($100-$150)

AMD CPUs with high clock speed:<br>
➤ Ryzen 9 7950X ($550-$650)<br>
➤ Ryzen 9 5900X ($350-$450)<br>
➤ Ryzen 7 5800X ($200-$300)<br>
➤ Ryzen 5 5600X ($100-$150)

* CPUs in a price range of $100-$300 should work fine with servers for 5-30 players if the server is well optimized. For a larger servers you should look for a better CPU in a price range of $300+ and don't forget to include RAM, SSD, motherboard and computer power supply costs.
